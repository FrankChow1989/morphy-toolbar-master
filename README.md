### Ever wanted a beautiful transition when switching fragments? 
Morphy Toolbar is your answer :)

## Overview

> Why did I create this library? I often read questions on stack overflow on how to reproduce an animation like this one, more or less always resulting in the use of the design support library **CollapsibleToolbar**. However, I find this library to be quite buggy, and it aims to be used for scrolling events.<br/>
> I needed this library to have a custom toolbar with a picture, title and subtitle, and the possibility to animate it when **switching fragments**.

- **Easiest integration ever**
- No need to handle transitions or whatever youself
- Perfect to animate a small changes **statically** without scrolling events
- Several customisations already possible, more to come
- Smooth animation for transitions (for example when switching fragments)

Sample
----------------

You can checkout the [Sample Application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.badoualy.morphytoolbar.sample) on the Play Store

Setup
----------------

First, add jitpack in your build.gradle at the end of repositories:
 ```gradle
repositories {
    // ...       
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}
```

Then, add the library dependency:
```gradle
compile 'com.github.badoualy:morphy-toolbar:1.0.4'
```

Now go do some awesome stuff!

Usage
----------------
``` java
// Attach to the given activity/toolbar
MorphyToolbar morphyToolbar = MorphyToolbar.builder(this, toolbar)
        .withToolbarAsSupportActionBar()
        .withTitle("Minions [not so] serious talk")
        .withSubtitle("160 participants")
        .withPicture(R.drawable.img_profile)
        .withHidePictureWhenCollapsed(false)
        .build();
        
morphyToolbar.expand();
morphyToolbar.collapse();
```

All the customizations are made using the builder methods, you can chose to hide the picture when in collpased mode, to not have any subtitle, ...

I'll gladly accept any merge request to enhance this library
